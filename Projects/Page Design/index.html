                   <p>Islamic University is ranked as one of the top public universities in Bangladesh as well as the largest seat of higher education in the south-western part of the country. Situated 24 kilometers south of Kushtia and 22 kilometers north of Jhenidah district-town in a lush green countryside, the university is by-passed by Khulna-Kushtia National Highway which provides its lifeline of connectivity with the rest of the country.</p>

                               <p> The passing of the Islamic University Act in 1980 conferred this institution the permanent prestige of being the first university established after the independence of Bangladesh, reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the new nation striving to be on par with other international players through the promotion of science, business, humanities, and interfaith dialogue.
